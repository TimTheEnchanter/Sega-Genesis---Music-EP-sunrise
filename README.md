# Sega Genesis - Music EP sunrise
 I want to try something a little weird here. Let's see if I can put some of my music onto a Sega Genesis cart. This is the test to get a feel for how much space I got to work with or if it is even feasible. Music being used: https://jamesparrott.bandcamp.com/album/sunrise
